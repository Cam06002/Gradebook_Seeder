# Gradebook_Seeder

This gradebook was created for use as a database seeder and uploaded to GCP. The data will be used to create dashboards similar to those used by Ed-Fi to demonstrate my skills in this field.

I first created a list dictionary containing all of the classes offered at "Jeff High School", then randomly generated the student body. I then assinged each of the 2000 fictional students a transcript, composed of 14 classes. Finally I compiled my results in a large dataframe and uploaded it to GCP for further manupilation with SQL.

To help calculate GPA's, I created a credit-hours dataframe and added it to my GCP database.
